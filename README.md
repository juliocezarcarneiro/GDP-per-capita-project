Authors: Anqa Javed, Humaira Enayetullah, Julio Carneiro, Shahab Eshghifard. 

##  üìä Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize patterns of socioeconomic development, income inequality, and growth across different countries using datasets from the Our World in Data catalog‚Äî GDP per capita, health care spending, the GINI index, and population density. The primary goal is to help us understand how national wealth, public investment in health, and income are distributed. By highlighting regional disparities and global patterns, the visualizations will offer valuable insights into how economic resources and social outcomes are distributed, ultimately  helping understand global development dynamics.
