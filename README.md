Global Wealth and Wellbeing: A deeper data dive into GDP, health, and income inequality in different countries

Authors: Anqa Javed, Humaira Enayetullah, Julio Carneiro, Shahab Eshghifard. 

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize global GDP per capita data to uncover economic economic trends, disparities, and growth patterns across countries and regions. Using the World Bank dataset on GDP per capita, health care spending, and income inequality (GINI index), this project will present the data through interactive and insightful visualizations that are accessible to both technical and non-technical users.  We will identify trends and correlations between national wealth, public investment in health, and how equitably income is distributed.

## Table of Contents
1. Overview
2. Tools

## Tools
* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* Visualization Libraries: D3.js, Plotly, Leaflet.js (mapping) and Seaborn
* Data Handling: CSV/Excel file parsing with JavaScript
* Database: PostgreSQL

## Project Goals
* Clean and structure data
* Process GDP, healthcare and income data for different countries. Store the cleaned data in a structured database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for efficient querying.
* Analyze economic patterns
    * Compare GDP per capita across countries and regions.
* Track growth trends over time.
Identify economic outliers and changes in development over the past decades.


Create interactive visualizations
Make the data engaging and easy to interpret through modern visualization tools.
Allow users to interact with data using filters and selection tools:
Bubble Chart (GDP vs Health Spending)
X-axis: GDP per capita
Y-axis: Health Spending
Bubble size: Population
Bubble color: Region or Gini Index
Choropleth Map
World map color-coded by Gini Index
Tooltip shows GDP & health spending


 Correlation Heatmap
Correlation matrix between GDP, Health Spending, Gini Index
Add year slider to let users explore trends over time
Research Questions
How has GDP per capita changed globally since 1960?
Which countries have shown the most consistent growth?
What is the correlation between GDP per capita, income and inequality index and the current health expenditure per capita?
