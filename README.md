# üåç Global Wealth and Wellbeing: A deeper data dive into GDP, health, and income inequality in different countriesüåç
Authors: Anqa Javed, Humaira Enayetullah, Julio Carneiro, Shahab Eshghifard. 

##  üìä Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize patterns of socioeconomic development, income inequality, and growth across different countries using datasets from the Our World in Data catalog‚Äî GDP per capita, health care spending, the GINI index, and population density. The primary goal is to help us understand how national wealth, public investment in health, and income are distributed. By highlighting regional disparities and global patterns, the visualizations will offer valuable insights into how economic resources and social outcomes are distributed, ultimately  helping understand global development dynamics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/global-wealth-and-wellbeing.git
2. Steps to Reproduce the Project
    * Open Dashboard/index.html in a browser
3. The map automatically loads the dashboard with interactive visualizations to understand how different countries have developed over the years.

## üìå Research Questions 
1. How has the wealth of the world‚Äôs top richest countries evolved over time?  
2. How have global living standards evolved over time, and who benefits the most?
3. What is the relationship between population density, national wealth, and health spending?
4. How has the global GINI Index changed over time across countries?

## üìù Summary of findings
* Luxembourg is the wealthiest nation and the third largest in healthcare expenditure because it has a small population and is a global finacial centeer with many private banking and wealth management. It also has tax friendly policies that attracts multination cooprporations and wealthy people to invest in the country.
* Switzerland spend the most on healthcare followed by other European countries like Austria and Germany as these countries have universal healthcare systems. Their populations are older on average, meaning more people require chronic care, long-term treatments, and age-related services.
* South Africa has the highest GINI scrore suggesting high income desparity. Although it is a upper middle income country, the wealth is concentrated in the hands of small minority due to the legacy of apartheid system, high unemployment, and education gap.
* In comparison, Canada and the United States are high income countries that do not have a high population density and have a higher GDP and spend more on healthcare than the world average.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Limitations
* Some countries had no data, so it was hard to make conclusions about their overall development.
* We did not have the latest data from last couple of years, so the maps have complete data till 2021.
* Any statistical analysis was not done to see if the results are statitically significant.

## üß≠ Data Ethical Considerations
Throughout this project, we tried our best to use data in a fair and responsible way. The datasets we used like GDP, GINI Index, Health Spending, and Population came from trusted public sources. We made sure to clean and organize the data carefully, without introducing any bias or misrepresenting any countries. When some data was missing or marked as "No data," we chose to show it as null rather than guessing or filling it in, so everything stayed honest and transparent. Our goal with the visuals was to help people understand global trends, not to mislead or reinforce stereotypes. We also made sure to mention any limitations in the data so viewers don‚Äôt make incorrect conclusions.
