# 🌍 Global Wealth and Wellbeing: A deeper data dive into GDP, health, and income inequality in different countries🌍
Authors: Anqa Javed, Humaira Enayetullah, Julio Carneiro, Shahab Eshghifard. 

##  📊 Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize patterns of socioeconomic development, income inequality, and growth across different countries using datasets from the Our World in Data catalog— GDP per capita, health care spending, the GINI index, and population density. The primary goal is to help us understand how national wealth, public investment in health, and income are distributed. By highlighting regional disparities and global patterns, the visualizations will offer valuable insights into how economic resources and social outcomes are distributed, ultimately  helping understand global development dynamics.

## 📌 Research Questions 
1. How has the wealth of the world’s top 10 richest countries evolved over time?  
2. How have global living standards evolved over time, and who benefits the most?
3. What is the relationship between population density, national wealth, and health spending?
4. Has income inequality decrease over time?

## 📝 Summary of findings
* Luxembourg is the wealthiest nation and the third largest in healthcare expenditure
* Switzerland spend the most on healthcare followed by other European countries like Austria and Germany as these countries have universal healthcare systems. Their populations are older on average, meaning more people require chronic care, long-term treatments, and age-related services.
* Canada
* US

## ⚠️  Limitations
* Some countries had no data, so it was hard to make conclusions about their overall development

## 🧭 Data Ethical Considerations
Throughout this project, we tried our best to use data in a fair and responsible way. The datasets we used like GDP, GINI Index, Health Spending, and Population came from trusted public sources. We made sure to clean and organize the data carefully, without introducing any bias or misrepresenting any countries. When some data was missing or marked as "No data," we chose to show it as null rather than guessing or filling it in, so everything stayed honest and transparent. Our goal with the visuals was to help people understand global trends, not to mislead or reinforce stereotypes. We also made sure to mention any limitations in the data so viewers don’t make incorrect conclusions.
